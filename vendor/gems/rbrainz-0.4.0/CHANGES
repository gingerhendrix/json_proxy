== 0.2.1 (2007-07-24)
* Erroneous date strings in the XML are ignored. No error is raised and nil
  is set for the date.
* MBXML#get_entity_list now returns an ScoredCollection even if no list-element
  is present in the XML. This is due to the fact that musicbrainz.org always
  returns an empty result <metadata/> if no matching entities were found.
* Removed custom eql? and include? methods from Range and added them to
  IncompleteDate. Those methods changed the behaviour of Range which might lead
  to unexcpected results in programs using RBrainz.
