module MusicBrainz
  module Webservice

    # A simple interface to the MusicBrainz web service.
    # 
    # This is a facade which provides a simple interface to the MusicBrainz
    # web service. It hides all the details like fetching data from a server,
    # parsing the XML and creating an object tree. Using this class, you can
    # request data by ID or search the _collection_ of all resources
    # (artists, labels, releases or tracks) to retrieve those matching given
    # criteria. This document contains examples to get you started.
    # 
    # 
    # == Working with Identifiers
    # MusicBrainz uses absolute URIs as identifiers. For example, the artist
    # 'Tori Amos' is identified using the following URI:
    #   http://musicbrainz.org/artist/c0b2500e-0cef-4130-869d-732b23ed9df5
    # 
    # In some situations it is obvious from the context what type of 
    # resource an ID refers to. In these cases, abbreviated identifiers may
    # be used, which are just the _UUID_ part of the URI. Thus the ID above
    # may also be written like this:
    #   c0b2500e-0cef-4130-869d-732b23ed9df5
    # 
    # All methods in this class which require IDs accept both the absolute
    # URI and the abbreviated form (aka the relative URI).
    # 
    # 
    # == Creating a Query Object
    # 
    # In most cases, creating a Query object is as simple as this:
    #   require 'rbrainz'
    #   q = MusicBrainz::Webservice::Query.new
    # 
    # The instantiated object uses the standard Webservice class to
    # access the MusicBrainz web service. If you want to use a different 
    # server or you have to pass user name and password because one of
    # your queries requires authentication, you have to create the
    # Webservice object yourself and configure it appropriately.
    # 
    # This example uses the MusicBrainz test server and also sets
    # authentication data:
    #   require 'rbrainz'
    #   service = MusicBrainz::Webservice::Webservice.new(
    #     :host     => 'test.musicbrainz.org',
    #     :username => 'whatever', 
    #     :password => 'secret'
    #   )
    #   q = MusicBrainz::Webservice::Query.new(service)
    # 
    # 
    # == Querying for Individual Resources
    # 
    # If the MusicBrainz ID of a resource is known, then the get_artist_by_id,
    # get_label_by_id, get_release_by_id or get_track_by_id method can be used
    # to retrieve it.
    # 
    # Example:
    #   require 'rbrainz'
    #   q = MusicBrainz::Webservice::Query.new
    #   artist = q.get_artist_by_id('c0b2500e-0cef-4130-869d-732b23ed9df5')
    #   puts artist.name
    #   puts artist.sort_name
    #   puts artist.type
    #   
    # _produces_:
    #   Tori Amos
    #   Amos, Tori
    #   http://musicbrainz.org/ns/mmd-1.0#Person
    # 
    # This returned just the basic artist data, however. To get more detail
    # about a resource, the _includes_ parameters may be used 
    # which expect an ArtistIncludes, ReleaseIncludes, TrackIncludes or
    # LabelIncludes object, depending on the resource type.
    # It is also possible to use a Hash for the _includes_ parameter where it
    # will then get automaticly wrapped in the appropriate includes class.
    # 
    # To get data about a release which also includes the main artist
    # and all tracks, for example, the following query can be used:
    #   require 'rbrainz'
    #   q = MusicBrainz::Webservice::Query.new
    #   release_id = '33dbcf02-25b9-4a35-bdb7-729455f33ad7'
    #   release = q.get_release_by_id(release_id, :artist=>true, :tracks=>true)
    #   puts release.title
    #   puts release.artist.name
    #   puts release.tracks[0].title
    # 
    # _produces_:
    #   Tales of a Librarian
    #   Tori Amos
    #   Precious Things
    # 
    # Note that the query gets more expensive for the server the more
    # data you request, so please be nice.
    # 
    # 
    # == Searching in Collections
    # 
    # For each resource type (artist, release, and track), there is one
    # collection which contains all resources of a type. You can search
    # these collections using the get_artists, get_releases, and
    # get_tracks methods. The collections are huge, so you have to
    # use filters (ArtistFilter, ReleaseFilter, TrackFilter or LabelFilter)
    # to retrieve only resources matching given criteria.
    # As with includes it is also possible to use a Hash as the filter where
    # it will then get wrapped in the appropriate filter class.
    # 
    # For example, If you want to search the release collection for
    # releases with a specified DiscID, you would use get_releases:
    #   require 'rbrainz'
    #   q = MusicBrainz::Webservice::Query.new
    #   results = q.get_releases(ReleaseFilter.new(:disc_id=>discId='8jJklE258v6GofIqDIrE.c5ejBE-'))
    #   puts results[0].score
    #   puts results[0].entity.title
    # 
    # _produces_:
    #   100
    #   Under the Pink
    #   
    # 
    # The query returns a list of results in a ScoredCollection, 
    # which orders entities by score, with a higher score
    # indicating a better match. Note that those results don't contain
    # all the data about a resource. If you need more detail, you can then
    # use the get_artist_by_id, get_label_by_id, get_release_by_id, or
    # get_track_by_id methods to request the resource.
    # 
    # All filters support the _limit_ argument to limit the number of
    # results returned. This defaults to 25, but the server won't send
    # more than 100 results to save bandwidth and processing power. In case
    # you want to retrieve results above the 100 results limit you can use the
    # _offset_ argument in the filters. The _offset_ specifies how many entries
    # at the beginning of the collection should be skipped.
    # 
    class Query
    
      # Create a new Query object.
      # 
      # You can pass a custom Webservice[link:classes/MusicBrainz/Webservice/Webservice.html]
      # object. If none is given a default webservice will be used.
      #
      # If the constructor is called without arguments, an instance
      # of WebService is used, preconfigured to use the MusicBrainz
      # server. This should be enough for most users.
      #
      # If you want to use queries which require authentication you
      # have to pass a Webservice instance where user name and
      # password have been set.
      #
      # The _client_id_ option is required for data submission.
      # The format is <em>'application-version'</em>, where _application_
      # is your application's name and _version_ is a version
      # number which may not include a '-' character.
      #
      # Available options:
      # [:client_id] a unicode string containing the application's ID.
      # [:factory]   A model factory. An instance of Model::DefaultFactory
      #              will be used if none is given.
