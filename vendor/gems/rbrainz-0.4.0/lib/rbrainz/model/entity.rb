    #
    # A first-level MusicBrainz class.
    # 
    # All entities in MusicBrainz have unique IDs (which are MBID's representing
    # absolute URIs) and may have any number of #relations to other entities.
    # This class is abstract and should not be instantiated.
    # 
    # Relations are differentiated by their <i>target type</i>, that means,
    # where they link to. MusicBrainz currently supports four target types
    # (artists, releases, tracks, and URLs) each identified using a URI.
    # To get all relations with a specific target type, you can use
    # #relations and pass one of the following constants as the
    # parameter:
    #
    # - Relation::TO_ARTIST
    # - Relation::TO_RELEASE
    # - Relation::TO_TRACK
    # - Relation::TO_URL
    #
    # See:: Relation

      # representing either a complete MBID URI or just the
      # UUID part of it. If it is a complete URI the entity
      # part of the URI must match the entity type returned
      # by +entity_type+ or an EntityTypeNotMatchingError
      # will be raised.
